InDesign Export Tool
=============

Description
-------


This is an AppleScript for exporting all open documents in diffent formats. Like:

* "PDF-Export" -- export as *pdf
* "IDML-Export" -- export as *idml

After executing the script in InDesign you'll be presented with a "function" dialog.
This is where you can choose from one of the functions above.
After that it depends on the function you chose.
The files are exported to the same directory as the *.indd files withe same name.



Contributing
------------

Want to contribute? Great! You sure know what to do, but this is my first repository so I don't know if I am doing this right :)

File-Formats
-----------
    Normally I use the *.scpt Format because it it precompiled but at the same time contains the code and viewable via QuickLook. 
    I'm also commiting an *.applescript File, just because it it readable on github and the precompiled not.
    They should be in sync, always.
    
Localization
-----------
    At the moment the script is mixed, english and german. with the documentation beeing in english but most used Strings in german.

Installation
-----------

    put the file in the application folder "Adobe InDesign CS5" > "Scripts" > "Scripts Panel"


Usage
-----

    open InDesign CS5 and some documents and start the script from the "Scripts Panel"
